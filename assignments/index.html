<!-- Structure -->
<h2>Lecture Time</h2>
Most weeks will have two required readings on a related topic. You are expected to read the papers before each lecture to prepare for engaging and meaningful in-class discussions. The lecture time will be split into three equal parts (40 minutes): 
<ol>
	<li>Student-led presentation and discussion for the first paper</li>
	<li>Student-led presentation and discussion for the second paper</li>
	<li>Discussion to compare and contrast the two papers</li>
</ol>

<!-- Reading Summaries -->
<h2>Reading Summaries</h2>
<p>You are expected to submit one written summary per assigned paper on Quercus (<a href="https://www.google.com">link</a>). The summaries are due 24 hours before the corresponding lecture. Each paper summary should include the following 5 components:
<ol>
	<li>Summary of the contribution in your own words (2–3 sentences)</li>
	<li>Your argument for accepting the paper if you were to review it (4–6 sentences)</li>
	<li>Your argument for rejecting the paper if you were to review it (4–6 sentences)</li>
</ol>
These summary components are designed to give you practice reviewing papers. All of these papers are published at major conferences and journals, so there is something good to be said about them. That being said, most published papers also have their own flaws. Writing about the good and bad of these papers will help you produce more balanced reviews in the long run.

<ol>
	<li value="4">Two discussion points</li>
</ol>
The discussion points will help the week's presenters lead the in-class conversation about the papers. Some suggested discussion points include questions about the work and proposals for future work. It is okay if these points overlap with points that are brought up in your summary or your reviews.
<ol>
	<li value="5">A numerical score of how much you enjoyed reading the paper (1 = not enjoyable to 5 = very enjoyable)</li>
</ol> 
This score is not intended to be interpreted as a review score. Instead, this score will simply be used to decide whether the paper will be included in future iterations of this course.
</p>

<!-- In-Class Presentations -->
<h2>In-Class Presentations</h2>
Everyone will be responsible for presenting at least one paper during the semester. The presentation (with slides) should last roughly 10-15 minutes, covering not only the methods and analysis being presented in the paper, but also the importance of the problem being addressed and a brief overview of the related work in that space. After your presentation, you will lead a 25-30 minute discussion with the rest of the class. To help you lead the conversation, you can refer to the discussion points that will be posted by your classmates at most 24 hours before the lecture.

<!-- Group Project -->
<h2>Group Project</h2>
Throughout the semester, you will work in groups of 2–3 students on a project related to mobile health. The only requirement for the topic of your project is that it involves some sort of sensor data from a portable device (e.g., smartphone, wearable, implant). You are encouraged to leverage any clinical collaborations that you might already have in place, but such a connection is not a requirement for your project given the limited time we have. Your project may involve a new data collection effort that can be completed during the semester, but it can also involve a new analysis of an existing dataset. You are highly encouraged to adapt your project to your research area to make it more relevant to your passions. If you are stuck trying to come up with an idea, the following links may be helpful:
<ul>
	<li>T-CAIREM: <a href="https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/collaboration-hub">Collaboration Hub</a></li>
	<li>Sage Bionetworks: <a href="https://dhealth.synapse.org/">Digital Health Knowlege Portal</a></li>
	<li>Dartmouth College: <a href="https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/">StudentLife Dataset</a></li>
	<li>PhysioNet: <a href="https://physionet.org/">Datasets and Challenges</a></li>
</ul> 

There will be intermediate deliverables during the semester, but the final submissions will include a 10-minute presentation at the end of the semester and a 5-page report submitted a week later. The report should follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">ACM Large</a> format (single-space, single-column) provided by the ACM.

<!-- Late Policy -->
<h2>Late Policy</h2>
Late submissions will not be accepted for the weekly reading summaries. Late submissions for any of the project milestones will incur a penalty as follows:
<ul>
	<li><24 hours late = –10% penalty</li>
	<li><48 hours late = –30% penalty</li>
	<li>>48 hours late = –100% penalty </li>
</ul>

<!-- Academic Conduct -->
<h2>Academic Conduct</h2>
<p>All the work you submit must be done by you (individually or within your group). Please refer to the university's <u><a href="http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Governing_Council/policies.htm">Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a></u> for more information.</p>
