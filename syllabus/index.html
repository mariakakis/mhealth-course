<!-- Reading Summaries -->
<h2 id="readings">Reading Summaries</h2>
<p>
You are expected to submit one written summary per assigned paper on Quercus. The summaries are due 24 hours before the corresponding lecture. Each paper summary should include the following five components:
<ol>
  <li>Summary of the contribution in your own words (2–3 sentences)</li>
  <li>Your argument for accepting the paper if you were to review it (4–6 sentences)</li>
  <li>Your argument for rejecting the paper if you were to review it (4–6 sentences)</li>
  <li>A discussion point or thought-provoking question</li>
  <li>A numerical score of how much you enjoyed reading the paper (1 = not enjoyable to 5 = very enjoyable)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The first three components are designed to give you practice reviewing papers. All of these papers are published at major conferences and journals, so there is something good to be said about them. That being said, most published papers also have their own flaws. Writing about the good and bad of these papers will help you produce more balanced reviews in the long run. The fourth component will help the week's presenters lead the in-class conversation about the papers. It is okay if these points overlap with points that are brought up in your summary or your reviews. The fifth and final component of the summary is designed to help us decide whether the paper will be included in future iterations of this course; the score is not intended to be treated as a reviewer's score.
</p>

<!-- Structure -->
<h2 id="present">Lecture Time and In-Class Presentations</h2>
<p>
Most weeks will have two required readings on a related topic. You are expected to read the papers before each lecture to prepare for engaging and meaningful in-class discussions. The lecture time will be split into three parts: 
<ol>
  <li>Presentation on related work in the topic of the day's lecture (15 minutes)</li>
  <li>Presentation (15 minutes) and discussion (30–40 minutes) for the first paper</li>
  <li>Presentation (15 minutes) and discussion (30–40 minutes) for the second paper</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Details about these presentations are given below:
<ul>
  <li><b>Related Work Presentation</b>: The purpose of this presentation is to get everyone up to speed on the topic that is associated with the week's papers. This presentation may cover seminal papers, research directions that are different from those of that day's papers, an overview of common methodologies, background information on prominent researchers in the field, and/or pointers to venues that feature the topic. Some of the topics are broader than others, so you may either expand or narrow the scope of the presentation as you see fit. If you do not know where to start, look at the related work for the papers that will be presented on the same day. You can also ask the TA(s) and the instructor for suggestions.</li>
  <li><b>Paper Presentation and Discussion</b>: The purpose of these presentations is to provide an overview of the paper to refresh everyone's memory for the discussion that will follow. This presentation should be similar to a conference talk in terms of breadth and depth. You should not only talk about what the authors did, but also the motivation of the work and the intuition behind their design choices. You do not need to spend too much time talking about prior work since that will be covered in the first presentation of the day, but you can highlight key predecessors when necessary. After the presentation, you will lead a discussion with the rest of the class about the paper. To help you lead the conversation, you can refer to the discussion points that will be posted by your classmates 24 hours before the lecture at the latest. It is very easy for people to criticize other papers, so be sure that the discussion also highlights the admirable aspects of the paper.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Everyone will be responsible for leading one lecture with another student. For the lecture that you are assigned, you are expected to work as a pair to create and deliver the Related Work Presentation. After you have decided amongst yourselves who is responsible for covering each paper associated with that lecture, you are also expected to individually create and deliver one of the Paper Presentations and lead the corresponding in-class discussion.
</p>

<!-- In-Class Participation -->
<h2 id="participate">In-Class Participation</h2>
<p>
You are not expected to have something insightful to say about every paper we read during this course. However, being an active participant in the majority of the discussions is integral to your learning in this course. You will get a reasonable participation grade as long as the TA(s) and I are easily able to recall your name and face based on your level of engagement in the discussions.
</p>

<!-- Group Project -->
<h2 id="project">Group Project</h2>
<p>
Throughout the semester, you will work in groups of 2–3 students on a project related to mobile health. The only requirement for the topic of your project is that it must involve some sort of contextual or sensor data from a portable device (e.g., smartphone, wearable, implant). Some examples of acceptable data sources may include, but are not limited to: IMU, camera, microphone, location, time, and app usage. Since the course is intended to satisfy curriculum requirements related to quantitative methods, the focus of the work should involve such techniques (e.g., machine learning, signal processing). Nevertheless, you are encouraged to use complementary methods when applicable.
</p>

<p>
You are encouraged to leverage any clinical collaborations that you might already have in place, but such a connection is not a requirement for your project given the limited time we have. Your project may involve a new data collection effort that can be completed during the semester, but it can also involve a new analysis of an existing dataset. You are highly encouraged to adapt your project to your research area to make it more relevant to your passions. If you are stuck trying to come up with an idea, the following resources and datasets may be helpful:
<ul>
  <li>T-CAIREM: <a href="https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/collaboration-hub">Collaboration Hub</a></li>
  <li>T-CAIREM: <a href="https://healthdatanexus.ai/"></a>Health Data Nexus</li>
  <li>Sage Bionetworks: <a href="https://dhealth.synapse.org/">Digital Health Knowlege Portal</a></li>
  <li>Dartmouth College: <a href="https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/">StudentLife Dataset</a></li>
  <li>University of Washington: <a href="https://the-globem.github.io/">GLOBEM Ddataset</a></li>
  <li>PhysioNet: <a href="https://physionet.org/">Datasets and Challenges</a></li>
  <li>University of California – Irvine: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php">Machine Learning Repository</a> (search "activity" or "smartphone")
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
There will be deliverables throughout the semester to ensure that your group is making sufficient progress on your project:
<ol>
  <li><b>Proposal</b>: A 2-page document proposing your idea and your execution plan</li>
  <li><b>Progress Report</b>: A 4-page document describing your progress halfway through the semester</li>
  <li><b>Final Presentation</b>: A 10-minute presentation summarizing your project</li>
  <li><b>Final Report</b>: A 10-page document akin to a journal or conference submission</li>
</ol>
All written documents should follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">ACM Large</a> format (single-space, single-column).
</p>

<!-- Late Policy -->
<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<p>
Late submissions will not be accepted for the weekly reading summaries. Late submissions for any of the project milestones will incur a penalty as follows:
<ul>
  <li><24 hours late = –10% penalty</li>
  <li><48 hours late = –30% penalty</li>
  <li>>48 hours late = –100% penalty </li>
</ul>
</p>

<!-- Academic Conduct -->
<h2>Academic Conduct</h2>
<p>
All the work you submit must be done by you (individually or within your group). Please refer to the university's <u><a href="http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Governing_Council/policies.htm">Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a></u> for more information.
