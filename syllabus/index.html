<!-- Reading Summaries -->
<h2 id="readings">Reading Summaries</h2>
<p>
You are expected to submit one written summary per assigned paper on Quercus. The summaries are due 24 hours before the corresponding lecture. Each paper summary should include the following five components:
<ol>
  <li>Two reasons for accepting the paper if you were reviewing it (minimum of 3 sentences per reason)</li>
  <li>Two reasons for rejecting the paper if you were reviewing it (minimum of 3 sentences per reason)</li>
  <li>A discussion point or thought-provoking question</li>
  <li>A numerical score of how much you enjoyed reading the paper (1 = not enjoyable to 5 = very enjoyable)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The first two components are designed to give you practice reviewing papers. All of these papers are published at major conferences and journals, so there is something good to be said about them. That being said, most published papers also have their own flaws. Writing about the good and bad of these papers will help you produce more balanced reviews in the long run. The third component will help the week's presenters lead the in-class conversation about the papers. It is okay if these points overlap with points that are brought up in your summary or your reviews. The final component of the summary is designed to help us decide whether the paper will be included in future iterations of this course; the score is not intended to be treated as a reviewer's score.
</p>

<!-- Structure -->
<h2 id="present">Lecture Time and In-Class Presentations</h2>
<p>
Most weeks will have two required readings on a similar topic. You are expected to read the papers before each lecture to prepare for engaging and meaningful in-class discussions. The lecture time will be split into two parts: The corresponding lecture time will be split as follows:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 55.8982%;" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Agenda Item</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Duration</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">Paper 1</td>
            <td>Topic Overview</td>
            <td>5 minutes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Paper Presentation</td>
            <td>10 minutes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Discussion</td>
            <td>40 minutes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">Paper 2</td>
            <td>Topic Overview</td>
            <td>5 minutes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Paper Presentation</td>
            <td>10 minutes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Discussion</td>
            <td>40 minutes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Each student should sign up to present 1&ndash;2 papers. The expectations for presenters are summarized below:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Topic Overview:</b> The purpose of this part of the presentation is to get everyone up to speed on the topic that is associated with the week's papers. You may decide to cover seminal papers, research directions that are different from those of the assigned papers, an overview of common methodologies in the field, background information on prominent researchers in the field, and/or pointers to venues that feature the topic. Some of the topics are broader than others, so you may either expand or narrow the scope of the presentation as you see fit. If you do not know where to start, look at the related work for the assigned papers or search for survey papers on the topic. You can also ask the TA(s) and the instructor for suggestions.</li>
  <li><b>Paper Presentation:</b> The purpose of this part of the presentation is to refresh everyone's memory about the paper for the discussion that will follow. The level of breadth and depth you cover should be similar to a conference talk. In other words, you do not need to cover every single design detail, result, or figure, but you should cover enough information so that people can be up to speed on the paper's content.</li>
  <li><b>Discussion:</b> Presenters are also expected to lead a discussion about the paper with the rest of the class. You should prepare for this discussion in advance by having a list of potential talking points listed somewhere in your slide deck. You can refer to your classmates' reading summaries in order to identify topics that may be of interest to the group. Since it is usually easier for people to criticize other people's work, try to ensure that the discussion points also highlight the admirable aspects of the paper. Leading the discussion not only requires preparation but also active involvement and moderation during the lecture time itself. If there is a lull in the discussion, you should either provide additional encouragement to your peers to provide their thoughts, extend the conversation by providing your own thoughts, or introduce a new topic of discussion. Some students choose to incorporate parts of the discussion into their presentation in order to make the conversation more fluid and spread out. If you do this, reasonable adjustments will be for the timing expectations in the grading.</li>
</ol>

<!-- In-Class Participation -->
<h2 id="participate">In-Class Participation</h2>
<p>
You are not expected to have something insightful to say about every paper we read during this course. However, being an active participant in the majority of the discussions is integral to your learning in this course. You will get a reasonable participation grade as long as the TA(s) and I are easily able to recall your name and face based on your level of engagement in the discussions.
</p>

<!-- Group Project -->
<h2 id="project">Group Project</h2>
<p>
Throughout the semester, you will work in groups of 2–3 students on a project related to mobile health. The only requirement for the topic of your project is that it must involve some sort of contextual or sensor data from a portable device (e.g., smartphone, wearable, implant). Some examples of acceptable data sources may include, but are not limited to: IMU, camera, microphone, location, time, and app usage. Since the course is intended to satisfy curriculum requirements related to quantitative methods, the focus of the work should involve such techniques (e.g., machine learning, signal processing). Nevertheless, you are encouraged to use complementary methods when applicable.
</p>

<p>
You are encouraged to leverage any clinical collaborations that you might already have in place, but such a connection is not a requirement for your project given the limited time we have. Your project may involve a new data collection effort that can be completed during the semester, but it can also involve a new analysis of an existing dataset. You are highly encouraged to adapt your project to your research area to make it more relevant to your passions. If you are stuck trying to come up with an idea, the following resources and datasets may be helpful:
<ul>
  <li>T-CAIREM: <a href="https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/collaboration-hub">Collaboration Hub</a></li>
  <li>T-CAIREM: <a href="https://healthdatanexus.ai/">Health Data Nexus</a></li>
  <li>Sage Bionetworks: <a href="https://dhealth.synapse.org/">Digital Health Knowlege Portal</a></li>
  <li>Dartmouth College: <a href="https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/">StudentLife Dataset</a></li>
  <li>University of Washington: <a href="https://the-globem.github.io/">GLOBEM Ddataset</a></li>
  <li>PhysioNet: <a href="https://physionet.org/">Datasets and Challenges</a></li>
  <li>University of California – Irvine: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php">Machine Learning Repository</a> (search "activity" or "smartphone")
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
There will be deliverables throughout the semester to ensure that your group is making sufficient progress on your project:
<ol>
  <li><b>Proposal</b>: A 2-page document proposing your idea and your execution plan</li>
  <li><b>Progress Report</b>: An 8-page document describing your progress halfway through the semester</li>
  <li><b>Final Presentation</b>: A 10-minute presentation summarizing your project</li>
  <li><b>Final Report</b>: A 10-page document akin to a journal or conference submission</li>
</ol>
All written documents should follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">ACM Large</a> format (single-space, single-column).
</p>

<!-- Late Policy -->
<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<p>
Late submissions will not be accepted for the weekly reading summaries. Late submissions for any of the project milestones will incur a penalty as follows:
<ul>
  <li><24 hours late = –10% penalty</li>
  <li><48 hours late = –30% penalty</li>
  <li>>48 hours late = –100% penalty </li>
</ul>
</p>

<!-- Academic Conduct -->
<h2>Academic Conduct</h2>
