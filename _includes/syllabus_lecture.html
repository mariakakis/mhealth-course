Most weeks will have two required readings on a similar topic. You are expected to read the papers before each lecture to prepare for engaging and meaningful in-class discussions. The lecture time will be split into two parts: The corresponding lecture time will be split as follows:

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 50%;" border="1">

      <tr>

Each student should sign up to present a paper at some point during the term. The expectations for presenters are summarized below:

<ul>
  <li><b>Paper Presentation:</b> The purpose of this presentation is to refresh everyone's memory about the paper for the discussion that will follow. In other words, you <b>need not and should not</b> go over every single design detail, result, or figure in the paper, but rather remind people about the overall contribution and the way that the authors went about making that contribution in their paper. Note that the instructor will provide a brief introduction about the day's topic, so you should scan through the slides that are posted on the course's website ahead of time to ensure that you will not end up repeating material.</li>
  <li><b>Discussion:</b> Presenters are also expected to lead a discussion about the paper with the rest of the class. You should prepare for this discussion in advance by having a list of potential talking points listed somewhere in your slide deck. You can refer to your classmates' reading summaries in order to identify topics that may be of interest to the group. Since it is usually easier for people to criticize other people's work, try to ensure that the discussion points also highlight the admirable aspects of the paper. Leading the discussion not only requires preparation but also active involvement and moderation during the lecture time itself. If there is a lull in the discussion, you should either provide additional encouragement to your peers to provide their thoughts, extend the conversation by providing your own thoughts, or introduce a new topic of discussion. Some students choose to incorporate parts of the discussion into their presentation in order to make the conversation more fluid and spread out. If you do this, reasonable adjustments will be for the timing expectations in the grading.</li>
