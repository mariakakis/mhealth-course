Throughout the semester, you will work in groups of 2 students on a project related to mobile health. The only requirement for the topic of your project is that it must involve some sort of contextual or sensor data from a portable device (e.g., smartphone, wearable, implant). Some examples of acceptable data sources may include, but are not limited to: IMU, camera, microphone, location, time, and app usage. Since the course is intended to satisfy curriculum requirements related to quantitative methods, the focus of the work should involve such techniques (e.g., machine learning, signal processing). Nevertheless, you are encouraged to use complementary methods when applicable.

You are encouraged to leverage any clinical collaborations that you might already have in place, but such a connection is not a requirement for your project given the limited time we have. Your project may involve a new data collection effort that can be completed during the semester, but it can also involve a new analysis of an existing dataset. You are highly encouraged to adapt your project to your research area to make it more relevant to your passions. Some examples of past projects are listed below:

<ul>
  <li><b>Evaluating Community Mobility Data for COVID-19 Forecasting:</b> In this project, we aim to investigate the utility of community mobility data from Google's COVID-19 Open Data Repository for the task of COVID-19 infection forecasting. We evaluate the performance of common prediction models when given or withheld access to community mobility data. We perform this evaluation on caseload inflection points, where current methods perform worst, to investigate whether the inclusion of community mobility data as an input feature can improve performance.</li>
  <li><b>Mental Fatigue Detection in Computer-related Tasks Using Eye Tracking and Monitoring Input Devices:</b> In this paper, we developed a computer task to induce fatigue while collecting user-input and eye-related measurements in addition to user-reported fatigue levels from 14 participants. Our goal was to find a correlation between collected user data and the user-reported fatigue level.</li>
  <li><b>Lab to Field Transitions in AI Models: Understanding Performance Deterioration and Shortcut Learning in Healthcare Data:</b> Many deep learning-based tools are initially developed within smaller lab and research environments and then deployed for a larger population in the field. As a consequence of this, the AI models might pick up biases and spurious shortcuts from the lab data which does not generalize to the field. We introduce a novel framework that utilizes a shuffled input model to estimate data bias and predict performance deterioration.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Idle Games in Promoting Adherence to Deep Breathing Exercises:</b> To motivate short and frequent practices of deep breathing exercises, we developed an idle game in which the core action is deep breathing. After validating the physiological efficacy of the breathing guide embedded in the idle game through an in-lab study with physiological sensors, we conducted a two-week study whose results demonstrate that idle games can better sustain deep breathing adherence than a standard guide.</li>

There will be deliverables throughout the semester to ensure that your group is making sufficient progress on your project:
<ol>
  <li><b>Proposal</b>: A document proposing your idea and your execution plan (1–3 pages)</li>
  <li><b>Progress Report</b>: A document describing your progress halfway through the semester (6–8 pages)</li>
  <li><b>Final Presentation</b>: A presentation summarizing your project (~10 minutes)</li>
  <li><b>Final Report</b>: A document akin to a journal or conference submission (10-14 pages)</li>
</ol>
All written documents should follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">ACM Large</a> format (single-space, single-column).
